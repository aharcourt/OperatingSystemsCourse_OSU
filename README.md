A few programs from my Operating Systems course at Oregon State University.

**SmallShellProgram -** A small shell program in C. The shell allows for the redirection of standard input and standard output and supports both foreground and background processes (controllable by the command line and by receiving signals). The shell also supports three built in commands: exit, cd, and status. 

**AdventureProgram -** Two programs implementing an adventure game. The first program randomly creates a series of files that hold descriptions of the in-game rooms and how the rooms are connected. The second program provides an interface for playing the game using the most recently generated rooms file. During the game, the player can enter a command that returns the current time - this functionality utilizes mutexes and multithreading.

**EncryptionProgram -** Five small programs that use socket programming to encrypt and decrypt information using a one-time pad-like system.
